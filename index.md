This site will serve as a [knowledge base](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_base) of your ideas related to our Digital Literacies course throughout the semester. It is built using the tool [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), but you don't need to know much about that.

What you'll be offering and submitting is the actual content of the site: the knowledge base posts themselves. This will involve two digital ltieracies that you will learn and develop throughout the semester:

1. Writing documents using [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/), a common markup language for digital writing.
2. Collaborative digital production using [GitHub](https://github.com/), an industry standard tool for professional and technical writing.

This is a **group** project, where your ideas, insights, and questions will affect the direction of the knowledge base. If there is anything you think would be useful, *do it*. The key affordance of GitHub is that every suggested change is available for us to review. If there is something you want but don't know how to do, *ask* or, better yet, create an issue on GitHub for folks to weigh in on.

I'm looking forward to seeing what we create!
